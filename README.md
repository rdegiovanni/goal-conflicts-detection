# A tool to detect Goal Conflicts based on LTL Satisfiability Checking

The tool computes a set of conflicts for goals specified in Linear-Time Temporal Logic (LTL).

##Dependencies
[Hashable-lib]: On linux, install libghc-hashable-dev. On mac, run cabal install hashable.

[hBDD](https://github.com/sebcrozet/HBDD) : a ROBDD library for haskell.

1. Clone the [HDBB](https://github.com/sebcrozet/HBDD) library.
2. In a terminal, move into the folder you've just downloaded, and run the following commands.
3. `cabal update`
4. `cabal install cabal-install`
5. `cabal configure`
6. `cabal install`

##Installation and Usage

1. Compile  
        `ghc -XNPlusKPatterns -outputdir build -o main Main.hs`

2. Run the tool     
`./main <path-to-file>`
        
        You can find some examples in the folder tests/
        
3. The tool will return the conflicts computed in the terminal.
4. If you want, you can convert the tableaux generated by the tool to images running:     
`./dot2jpeg.sh`
        
        This will convert the dot files generated by the tool to jpeg format. 
        Please note that the output of the tool is placed in output/
