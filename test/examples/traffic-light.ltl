--Light can be any of three colors: green, yellow, read
Goals:
--Liveness: traffic light is green infinitely often
G(F(green)) ;

--Chronological ordering: once red, the light cannot become green immediately
--AG (red -> EX (!green));
Domain:
--More detailed: once red, the light always becomes green eventually after being yellow for some time
G(red -> F green) ;
G(red -> ( (!green) U yellow)) 
--AG(red -> (A red U (yellow && (A yellow U green))))
