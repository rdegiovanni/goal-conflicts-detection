--When the train is approaching (ta), then the gate should be closed (tc) so the train can cross (tc). 
--When a car approaches to the crossing (ca), then the gate opens (go) and car crosses (cc). 
--Of course, the train and the car cannot be crossing at the same time.
Goals:
G (ta -> X (gc && tc));
G (ca -> X (go && cc));
G (!tc || !cc)

--Domain:
--AG (go <-> !gc);
