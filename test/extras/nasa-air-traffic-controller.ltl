Goals:
--Safety: Every conflict is addressed immediately (i.e in one time step)
G(!tsafeclear -> X(tsafecommand));

-- Safety: The system will never issue conflicting commands
G(!arcommand || !tsafecommand);

--Liveness: All conflicts are eventually resolved
G(!tsafeclear -> F(tsafeclear)) ;
-- Liveness: All controller requests are eventually addressed
G(controllerrequest -> F(!controllerrequest));
--Liveness: All aircraft requests are eventually addressed
G(aircraftrequest -> F(!aircraftrequest))
